#CNN-Convolutional-Neuron-Netowork
Here you will all kind of code related to CNN architecture for your AI projects practice 
<h2>[1]: STNNN (Sum of Three Numbers Neuron Networn)</h2>
<pre>
  In this network we are predicting the sum of three numbers using CNNs in range 1, 100
  the model we trained has the max accuracy of 100% you have the model archeticture and
  the pretrained weights with optimizer for finetuning for other task 
  all the data are generated vertually and real
